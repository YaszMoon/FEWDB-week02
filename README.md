# FEWDB-week02

## Description

The challenge for week 2 was to create a portfolio page which can be used to display progress through the course later on.

Visit the deployed page [here](https://yaszmoon.github.io/FEWDB-week02/).

## User Story

**AS AN** aspiring Front End Web Developer\
**I WANT** to be able to showcase my work\
**SO THAT** future employers may have evidence of my capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Limitations

* Circumstances prevented me from having enough time to reproduce the sample given.
* Also ran into some issues with the code which caused some misalignment; will need a tutoring session to get some assistance.
* Not yet possible to fulfill all the the acceptance criteria.
